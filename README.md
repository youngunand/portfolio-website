# portfolio_website

This project should showcase all of my interests, projects and visions on one page.

The architecture is built so that I can add a new ProjectShowcase easily, by only adding a new ProjectShowcase Widget to the ListView 
and simply provide all the necessary arguments. The website is hosted using GithubPages, which comes in handy as the builds update automatically
when pushing to this repository.
